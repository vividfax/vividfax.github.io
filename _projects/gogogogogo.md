# GOGOGOGOGOGO

<div class="indent">

is a co-op first-person driving **game** set in a retrofuturistic version of Busan.

I'm big into indie games and when a friend invited me onto a project I enthusiastically volunteered myself for anything that I could help out with.

**UI design**<br>

<div class="indent">

Working remotely with a geographically diverse eight-person team, I designed the UI in **Adobe XD** and built it in **Unity**, and drew vector art in **Illustrator**.

**3D modelling**

<div class="indent">

I made some low-poly skyscrapers and landmarks in **Maya**.
